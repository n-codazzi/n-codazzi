### 📚 **Currently Learning and Doing**  
- **NextJS**, **ReactJS** & **TailwindCSS** (Still figuring out some stuff but hey, I'm getting there!)
- **Cybersecurity** (Because who doesn't love hacking things... in a legal way, of course)
- **Competitive Programming** (Back to the basics with **C++** and **Vanilla JS**)

> *“Learning to code is like learning a new language, except you can break things and the computer doesn’t get offended.”* 😅

### 🚀 **What I'm Working On**  
- **NextJS Website Revamp** for a **Cat Association** 🐱: Who says you can't combine cats with tech? I'm working on building an awesome new site with a **CMS** (Admin dashboard still TBD... but it's coming).
- **Competitive Programming**: Re-entering the competitive coding world in my free time. Expect to see me on **LeetCode** and **Codewars** soon.
- **Cybersecurity Projects**: Just a hobby for now, but I’m diving deeper into network security and penetration testing tools. Also to add security to my projects.

### 🤝 **Let's Build Something Together!**  
I’m always excited to contribute to **open-source** projects. If you're working on something cool, hit me up! Also, if you’re just looking for a collaborator on a side project or need someone who loves to discuss tech (and cats), let’s chat!
